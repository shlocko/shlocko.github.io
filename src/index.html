                    <p>I am a Computer Science student looking to enter the field while
                    pursuing my degree and passion for software development.</p>
                    <p>I am currently based in Southern California, United States,
                    and am looking to enter the field. I currently specialise in web
                    technologies such as Javascript/Typescript, with an interest in
                    the back end with NodeJS or Rust.</p>
                    <p>I first began my interest in programming and web development
                    in highschool, as I had a growing fascination with the web,
                    and sought the skills to design websites of my own. Between
                    the few classes my highschool offered for web development and my
                    own unending need to write projects myself, I learned to program
                    and build websites for myself. Since then I have branched out into
                    a love of writing small games, and other projects I truly enjoy.
